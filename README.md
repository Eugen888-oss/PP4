# PP4

## Goal

In this exercise you will:

* Use SSH to connect to remote servers from WSL, macOS, or Linux shells, understanding the handshake and authentication process.
* Generate an Ed25519 SSH key pair and explain the concept of digital signatures.
* Configure your local SSH client via the `~/.ssh/config` file for streamlined access.
* Securely copy files between local and remote hosts using `scp`, including local-to-remote, remote-to-local, and remote-to-remote transfers.
* Automate startup tasks on the remote server by writing a shell script that runs at login and explaining the role of `~/.bashrc` vs. `~/.profile`.

**Important:** Start a stopwatch when you begin and work uninterruptedly for **90 minutes**. Once time is up, stop immediately and record exactly where you paused.

## Tasks

### Task 1: SSH Login

**Objective:** Establish an SSH connection and observe each stage of the process.

1. From your local shell (WSL, macOS Terminal, or Linux), log into the `vorlesungsserver` (or any other remote machine of your choice, e.g. your own raspberry pi):

   ```bash
   ssh youruser@remotehost
   ```
2. Carefully observe and note each step:

   * **TCP connection** to port 22 on `remotehost`.
   * **SSH protocol handshake**: key exchange and algorithm negotiation.
   * **Authentication**: public-key or password exchange.
   * **Shell allocation**: your remote session starts.
3. After login, exit the session with `exit`.

**Provide:**

```bash
# 1) The exact ssh command you ran
ssh user11@128.140.85.215 -v

# 2) A detailed, step-by-step explanation of what happened at each stage

### Task 2: Ed25519 Key Pair

**Objective:** Create a secure key pair and explain how digital signatures verify identity.

1. Generate an Ed25519 SSH key pair:

   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```

   * Accept the default file location (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519`). Or provide the `-f <filepath>` option additionally.
   * Enter a passphrase when prompted (optional).
2. Locate and inspect your `id_ed25519` (private key) and `id_ed25519.pub` (public key).
3. Install your key on the remote machine (e.g. `vorlesungsserver`.
4. Explain in writing:

   * How the **private key** is used to sign challenges.
   * How the **public key** on the server verifies signatures without revealing the private key.
   * Why Ed25519 is preferred (performance, security).

**Provide:**

```bash
# 1) The ssh-keygen command you ran
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "eugen.risling@stud.thga.de"

# 2) The file paths of the generated keys
/home/eugen/.ssh/id_ed25519
/home/eugen/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

# 3) Your written explanation (3â€“5 sentences) of the signature process
The command creates a key pair (private and public). This is done in the ed25519 code.
You'll be asked for the storage location and whether you want to enter a passphrase.
The key is then created. The key consists of numbers and digits, such as the email address.
 A random art image is also created.

---

### Task 3: SSH Config File

**Objective:** Simplify SSH commands via `~/.ssh/config`.

1. Open (or create) `~/.ssh/config` in `vim`.
2. Add entries for your hosts, for example:

   ```text
   Host my-remote
       HostName remote.example.com
       User youruser
       IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

   Host backup-server
       HostName backup.example.com
       User backupuser
       Port 2222
       IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_backup
   ```
3. Save and close the file, then test:

   ```bash
   ssh my-remote
   ssh backup-server
   ```
4. Explain:

   * How SSH reads `~/.ssh/config` and matches hosts.
     The name is searched for.
   * The difference between `HostName` and `Host`.
     Hostname is the name for a computer in a network, a host is just a aliases name.
   * How aliases prevent long commands.
     The aliases are shortcuts for long commands.

**Provide:**

```text
# 1) The full contents of your ~/.ssh/config
Host my-remote
               HostName remote.example.com
               User eugen
               IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

# 2) A short explanation (3â€“4 sentences) of how the config simplifies connections
The SSH file stores the parameters necessary for connecting to a host.
For example, the path to the SSH key is stored here.
It also contains information about the username, host address, and port.
This file eliminates the need to enter anything separately when connecting;
it is read automatically from the config file.

### Task 4: SCP File Transfers

**Objective:** Practice copying files securely using `scp`.

1. **Local â†’ Remote**:

   ```bash
   scp /path/to/localfile.txt youruser@remotehost:~/destination/
   ```
2. **Remote â†’ Local**:

   ```bash
   scp youruser@remotehost:~/remotefile.log ./local_destination/
   ```
3. **Remote â†’ Remote** (between two directories on the same remote host):

   ```bash
   scp -r youruser@remotehost:/path/dir1 youruser@remotehost:/path/dir2
   ```
4. For each command:

   * Verify file timestamps and sizes after transfer, using `ls -la`
  user11@vorlesung:~$ ls -la

   * Note any flags you used (e.g., `-r`, `-P` for port).
4. Explain:

   * How `scp` initiates an SSH session for each transfer.
   * The role of encryption in protecting data in transit.

**Provide:**

```bash
# 1) Each scp command you ran
scp ~/eugen1.txt user11@128.140.85.215:~/

scp user11@128.140.85.215:/home/user11/eugen1.txt ./lokal

# 2) Any flags or options used
No options used.
# 3) A brief explanation (2â€“3 sentences) of scpâ€™s mechanism
SCP is a service for copying files to and from a remote host and back to the local PC over a secure SSH connection.
A password must be entered for each operation.

---

### Task 5: Login Shell Script & Profile Explanation

**Objective:** Automate commands at login and understand shell initialization files.

1. On the **remote** server, create a script `~/login_tasks.sh` containing at least three commands you find useful (e.g., `echo "Welcome $(whoami)"`, `uptime`, `ls ~/projects`). You may either use `vim` or try the following to create a file from your commandline directely:

   ```bash
   cat << 'EOF' > ~/login_tasks.sh
   #!/usr/bin/env bash
   echo "Welcome $(whoami)! Today is $(date)."
   uptime
   ls ~/projects
   EOF
   chmod +x ~/login_tasks.sh
   ```

> The files content should be something akin to:
> ```bash
> #!/usr/bin/env bash
> echo "Welcome $(whoami)! Today is $(date)."
> uptime
> ls ~/projects
> ```

2. Append to your `~/.bashrc` (or `~/.profile` if using a login shell) a line to source this script on each new session:

   ```bash
   echo "source ~/login_tasks.sh" >> ~/.bashrc
   ```
3. Log out and log back in to trigger the script.
4. Explain:

   * The difference between `~/.bashrc` and `~/.profile` (interactive vs. login shells).
   * Why and when each file is read.
   * How sourcing differs from executing.

**Provide:**

```bash
# 1) The contents of login_tasks.sh
# 2) The lines you added to ~/.bashrc or ~/.profile
# 3) Your explanation (3â€“5 sentences) of shell init files and sourcing vs. executing
```

---

**Remember:** Stop working after **90 minutes** and record where you stopped.
